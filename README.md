## ABOUT THE REPOSITORY

### ABOUT THE FOLDER "VILLE"
It contains ville.cpp with his executable program. This is where I've started learning C++ language: CLASSES. 
I approached the notion of getters and setters, class constructor and method that make appear the town and his department, the instanciation of an object of the class Ville and using a method on an object.

## ABOUT THE FOLDER "PERSONNE"

This folder contains the code sheet and his executable. Here I defined the properties of the class, methods and constructors. The specification here is that I have declared the methods and constructor in the class and defined them outside. Over this specification the personne.cpp is the same as ville.cpp
